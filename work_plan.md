## Work plan

1. [10/1 ... 1.5h] Create a set of test benches for each plan.

2. [10/3 ... 3h] Come up with control logic for each function we have to perform.
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - XOR
  - SLT (is less than)
  - AND
  - NAND
  - NOR
  - OR

3. [10/3 ... 0.5h] Create block diagrams for our ALU.
  - Top level, not too detailed.

4. [10/4 ... 1h] Test the individual operations and make note of when the test bench catches a flaw in our design.

5. [10/4 ... 1h] Capture and analyze the worst case propagation delay for each function.

6. [10/6 ... 1.5h] Write report.
  - For each operation, write a paragraph for what tests we chose and why we chose them.

7. [10/6 ... 0.5h] Write reflection.
